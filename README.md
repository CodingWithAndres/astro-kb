# 🌌 Astrology Knowledge Base  

This project is my semester-long exploration of astrology, built as part of **CMPA 3302**. It organizes key concepts like zodiac signs, planets, houses, and relationship dynamics into a connected knowledge base.  

The goal is to create a structured yet easy-to-navigate resource that demonstrates how organizing systems, classification, and links can turn information into a living network of insights.
