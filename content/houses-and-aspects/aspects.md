# Major Aspects 🔭  

Aspects describe the angles planets form with one another, symbolizing how their energies interact.  

## Key Aspects  

- **Conjunction (0°)** → Blends energies together, powerful unity.  
- **Opposition (180°)** → Tension, balance between opposites.  
- **Trine (120°)** → Easy flow, natural harmony.  
- **Square (90°)** → Challenge, friction that sparks growth.  
- **Sextile (60°)** → Opportunity, supportive energy.
