# About ✨  

Hi! I’m **Andres** 👋  

This Astrology Knowledge Base is my semester-long project, created to organize and share insights into astrology. Here, you’ll find:  
- Overviews of zodiac signs ♈  
- The influence of planets 🌌  
- The role of houses and aspects 🏡  
- How compatibility and synastry work in relationships 💕  

It’s a space where I combine structure, learning, and a bit of creativity — part study project, part personal exploration.
