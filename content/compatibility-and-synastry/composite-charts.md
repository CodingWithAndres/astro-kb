# Composite Charts 💞  

A composite chart combines two natal charts into one “relationship chart.” Instead of comparing placements (like in synastry), it calculates the midpoints between each person’s planets to create a symbolic chart for the relationship itself.

## What Composite Charts Show:

- **Relationship identity** → The "personality" of the relationship as its own entity.  
- **Strengths and challenges** → Where the partnership flows and where effort is needed.  
- **Longevity** → Insights into how the relationship evolves over time.
---
## Key Features:

- The **Sun** in the composite chart = core purpose of the relationship.  
- The **Moon** = emotional needs within the bond.  
- **Venus and Mars** = romantic and physical dynamics.  
- The **Ascendant/Descendant axis** = how the relationship is expressed outwardly and how it connects with others.

## Example;

If Person A has Venus at 10° Aries and Person B has Venus at 10° Leo, the composite Venus would be at 10° Gemini — symbolizing how love manifests within the relationship itself.  

> “A composite chart is less about *you* or *me* — it’s about *us*.”
