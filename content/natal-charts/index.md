# Natal Charts 🧭  

A natal chart (or birth chart) is like a cosmic map — a snapshot of the sky at the exact time and place you were born. It shows how the planets, signs, and houses align to shape your personality, strengths, challenges, and life path.

## What’s Inside a Natal Chart
- **Planets** → Show *what* energies are active.
