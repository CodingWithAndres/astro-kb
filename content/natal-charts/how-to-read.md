# How to Read a Natal Chart 📖  

A natal chart may look like a wheel of mysterious symbols, but breaking it down step by step makes it approachable.  

## Steps to Reading a Natal Chart
1. **Locate the Ascendant (Rising Sign)** → Sets the stage for the chart; it determines the house placements.  
2. **Identify the Sun, Moon, and Rising** → The “Big Three” reveal core personality, emotional world, and outward style.  
3. **Check Planet Placements** → Each planet in a sign shows a specific energy expression.  
4. **Review the Houses** → Planets in houses show *where* in life those energies are focused.  
5. **Study Aspects** → Look for conjunctions, squares, trines, oppositions, and sextiles that color how planets interact.
