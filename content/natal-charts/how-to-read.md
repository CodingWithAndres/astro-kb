# How to Read a Natal Chart 📖  

A natal chart can look intimidating at first — a circle filled with symbols, lines, and numbers. But once you know the basics, it becomes a powerful guide for understanding yourself and others.

## Step 1: Gather Birth Information  
You need three key details:  
1. **Date of Birth**  
2. **Exact Time of Birth**  
3. **Place of Birth**  

These details pinpoint the positions of the planets, signs, and houses at the moment you were born.  

---

## Step 2: Understand the Core Components  
- **Sun Sign** → Your core identity and vitality.  
- **Moon Sign** → Your emotions and inner world.  
- **Rising Sign (Ascendant)** → How you present yourself outwardly.  
- **Planets** → Each represents an area of energy (communication, love, drive, etc.).  
- **Houses** → Show the life areas where these energies express themselves.  
- **Aspects** → The angles between planets that show harmony, tension, or growth.

## Step 3: Put It All Together  
Interpretation is about blending:  
- *What* (the planet)  
- *How* (the sign)  
- *Where* (the house)  
- *In relationship with what* (the aspects)  

---

## Quick Tip  
Don’t try to read everything at once. Start with the **Sun, Moon, and Rising**, then slowly layer in planets, houses, and aspects.
