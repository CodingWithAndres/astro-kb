# Getting Started ✨ 

Ready to dive into astrology? Here’s a step-by-step path:  

1. **Generate your natal chart**  
   Use a free chart tool like [Astro.com](https://www.astro.com/cgi/ade.cgi?ract=xx68747470733a2f2f7777772e617374726f2e636f6d2f6367692f63686172742e6367693f72733d3326627479703d77326777&lang=e&rs=3&btyp=w2gw) or [Astro-Charts.com](https://astro-charts.com/).  

2. **Identify your “Big Three”**  
   - Sun (core self)  
   - Moon (emotions)  
   - Rising sign (outer personality)  

3. **Learn Planet Roles**  
   Start with personal planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars) before tackling the outer planets.  

4. **Explore Houses & Aspects**  
   See where life themes show up and how planets interact.  

5. **Connect the Pieces**  
   Practice reading combinations — not just one placement at a time.  

> Tip: Start with your own chart for personal reflection, then branch out to friends and family.
