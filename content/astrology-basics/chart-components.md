# Chart Components ðŸ—º  

A natal chart is made up of four main building blocks:  

1. **Planets** â†’ The *what*. These show different energies (ex: Mercury = communication).  
2. **Signs** â†’ The *how*. Each planet expresses itself through a zodiac sign.  
3. **Houses** â†’ The *where*. The areas of life (career, relationships, family) where energy plays out.  
4. **Aspects** â†’ The *how they interact*. Planets form angles that create harmony, tension, or growth.

## Example  
- **Mars in Leo in the 5th House**: Passion (Mars) is expressed dramatically (Leo) in the area of creativity, romance, and hobbies (5th House).  

> When you read a chart, youâ€™re always blending *planet + sign + house + aspect*.
