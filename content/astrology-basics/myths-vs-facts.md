# Myths vs Facts 🌀  


>Astrology often gets misunderstood. Let’s clear up some common myths:

---
### Myth: “Astrology predicts the future.”  
**Fact**: Astrology describes patterns and tendencies. It shows possibilities, not certainties.  

### Myth: “People with the same sign are all alike.”  
**Fact**: A full chart matters — rising, moon, planets, and aspects create unique differences.  

### Myth: “Mercury retrograde ruins everything.”  
**Fact**: Retrogrades highlight reflection and review, not doom. Challenges arise if we resist slowing down.  

### Myth: “Astrology isn’t scientific, so it’s useless.”  
**Fact**: Astrology is symbolic, like a language or framework for reflection, not a lab science. Many use it as a tool for self-awareness.
