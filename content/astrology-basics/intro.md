# Introduction to Astrology 📜  

Astrology is the ancient practice of studying the relationship between celestial movements and human life. At its core, it explores how the positions of the **Sun, Moon, planets, and stars** at a given moment can reflect personality traits, events, and patterns.  

Astrology is not about “predicting fate” but about offering **symbolic language** and **tools for reflection**.
